## Normal Distribution
base R
```{r}
boxplot(rnorm(100, mean=1, sd = 1), rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1), rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=2))
```
GGplot
```{r}
# Generate random normal data
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data <- data.frame(
  Group = rep(c("Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"), each = 20),
  Value = c(rnorm(20, mean = 1, sd = 1),
            rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 1),
            rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 2))
)

ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

What does it mean to get "another sample" in our confidence intervals?
Data: Sample of BYU Creamery Chocolate Milk Bottles
```{r}
choc <- c(16.1308, 16.0294, 16.1459, 16.1009, 15.9948, 16.1127)
# Another Sample doesn't mean go get more bottles, it means another sample from a Normal(16, 0.01)
sample2 <- rnorm(6, mean = 16, sd = sqrt(0.01))
sample2
