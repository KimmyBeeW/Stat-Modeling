#Q14-15
#Photoresist is a light-sensitive material applied to semiconductor wafers so 
# that the circuit pattern can be imaged onto the wafer. After application, the 
# coated wafers are baked to remove the solvent in the photoresist mixture and 
# to harden the resist. Here are measurements of photoresist thickness (in kA) 
# for eight wafers baked at 95C and eight wafers baked at 100C. Assume that all 
# 16 of the runs were made in random order.

#95 C: 11.176, 7.089, 8.097, 11.739, 11.291, 10.759, 6.467, 8.315
#100 C: 5.263, 6.748, 7.461, 7.015, 8.133, 7.418, 3.772, 8.963

#Is there evidence to support the claim that the higher baking temperature 
# results in wafers with a lower mean photoresist thickness? Use Î± = 0.05.
# mean(y)-mean(x)<0
